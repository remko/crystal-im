About
-----
These are a set of iconsets for Psi, based on the Crystal SVG iconset by
Everaldo Coelho (http://www.everaldo.com). Many thanks to him for creating these 
beautiful icons.


Building
--------
To build the iconsets, just type:
	make

This should build all the iconsets, and create the JISPs in the current
directory.


Installing
----------
To use the iconsets under Psi, it suffices to copy the .jisp files into the
right directory. Put the system iconset in PSIDIR/iconsets/system, and
the other iconsets in PSIDIR/iconsets/roster. Alternatively, under Linux and
MacOS you can put them in ~/.psi/iconsets/roster and ~/.psi/iconsets/system for
convenience. Then, assign the iconsets in the Options dialog of Psi:
    * Select Crystal (System) as the system iconset
    * Select Crystal (Roster) as default roster iconset
    * From the Services tab of the roster iconsets, choose Crystal (Transport) 
	  as the Default
    * Optionally assign other transport iconsets to the transports
